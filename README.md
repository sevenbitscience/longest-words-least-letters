# Longest Words, Least Letters
A quick program I wrote to find, as the name implies, the longest word with the least number of unique letters. From the wordlist I used it came up with mmmm as the overal best and kinnikinnik as the best with at least 2 different letters.

The words are scored by dividing the word's length by the number of unique letters.
